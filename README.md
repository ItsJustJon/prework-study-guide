# Pre-work for Bootcamp

## Description

This repo is for my computer programming bootcamp "prework". I did not know about "prework" prior to enrollment, so this is really being done concurrently with the frist 2 weeks of class.

FAQ:
- What was my motivation? Because one day I am going to get pushed out of my corporate job, and I want to make sure I have sufficiently "re-tooled" myself for a potential career in software development.
- Why did I build this project? To learn how to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git Hub.
- What problem does it solve? It provides a "workbench" and framework for learning.
- What did I learn? Fundamentals of the above-listed languages.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

I don't have a long README, so I don't really need a TOC.
